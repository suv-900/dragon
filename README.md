Dragon is a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed for quick note-taking. It allows you to write notes directly in the terminal and save the changes to a specified filename. Please note that Dragon is currently not ready for use and is under development.

## Usage

To use Dragon, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. ~~Navigate to the directory where Dragon is installed~~.(working on making directory in working directory)
3. Run the following command:

```bash
dragon filename
```


Replace `filename` with the desired name for your note file. If the file already exists, Dragon will open it for editing; otherwise, it will create a new file with the provided name.

4. Once you have finished writing your notes, press `ctrl+s` to save.
5. Dragon will automatically save the changes to the specified `filename`.

## Limitations

Dragon is currently under development and is not ready for use. As a result, there may be bugs, incomplete features, and potential data loss. Please exercise caution and avoid using Dragon for important or sensitive note-taking tasks until it reaches a stable release.
